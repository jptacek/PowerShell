PowerShell
==========

Useful PowerShell Utilities

1 *Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1* (Profile folder) is the PowerShell profile script I use. It has 5 different modes
 * default
 * EndUser
 * Developer
 * SharePoint
 * Admin

 based on the mode you are running, it will change screen colors and title bar to indicate to you.

 2 *removeWirelessProfile.ps1*

 I have run into issues with Windows 8.1 creating many wireless profiles on my computer over time for a single hidden
 wireless network. I use this script to rip through them and delete them all. More info at
